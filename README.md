# Brief

## Instabug 
- This app is a task provided by [Instabug](https://www.instabug.com/) which is a technology company that provides software tools for mobile app developers to facilitate bug reporting, performance monitoring, and user feedback collection. Their solutions are designed to enhance the quality and reliability of mobile applications by enabling developers to identify and fix issues more efficiently.

## Task
- Build a mobile app using (React Native ✔️) or Flutter that displays a list of movies fetched from an API, implementing the network call functions as native modules for React Native or platform-specific code for Flutter, with the calls initiated from the respective framework.

# Getting Started

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the Cinema app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully ran the Cinema React Native App. :partying_face:
